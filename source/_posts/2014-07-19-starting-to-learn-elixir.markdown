It’s been a long time since I’ve really dug into a new programming language. I
think it’s probably been about two years. That is way too long. I don’t
necessarily feel like I’m getting stale, but I want to at least get back on
track with learning one programming language per year. This year, is going to be
the year of _Elixir_.

So what is Elixir and why did I choose it? Elixir is described on it’s website
as follows:
>Elixir is a functional, meta-programming aware language built on top of the
>Erlang VM. It is a dynamic language that focuses on tooling to leverage
>Erlang’s abilities to build concurrent, distributed and fault-tolerant
>applications with hot code upgrades.

Besides getting back on track with learning a programming language a year, I
really want to learn a functional programming language soup to nuts. I know a
few of the concepts and have played around a bunch, but I have yet to really dig
in all the way and build anything of any real use.

Here are few more reasons:

  * There are a few projects that I’ll be making this year that sound like the
  could be a good fit for Elixir (given what I’ve heard).
  * Modern tooling that sits on the Erlang VM. Gives me an opportunity to
  understand the Erlang VM while also write code in a language I’m likely to
  enjoy and use.

I’ll post more about it as a go. For now, I’m just looking forward to learning
something new.
