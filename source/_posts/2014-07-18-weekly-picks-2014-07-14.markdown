I’m trying something new. Posting my evernote web clips from the past week.
We’ll see if I can do it every week. I’m going to give it my best.

### Amazon Cognito
http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/

This looks like Amazon play at being a SSO as a Service. I always thought they
were going to try to merge it in with IAM, but I can see why they didn’t. They
are very different things. The cool thing is that you can store and sync across
devices apparently. I don’t know much about the service yet, but definitely plan
on checking it out soon.

### Amazon Zocalo
http://aws.amazon.com/zocalo/

Amazon’s second offering this week. It looks like it’s they’re offering to
compete with Google Drive and potentially dropbox. Seems like a decent
multi-user real time document contribution service. I kind of doubt that I’ll be
using it any time soon though.

### XDomain
https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain

Looks like a way to get around CORs purely in the browser. Have no idea how it
works, but it caught my eye,

### Coreutils View
https://github.com/Xfennec/cv

This was pretty cool. It adds progress monitoring to a few coreutil commands
(cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip, cat, etc). Going to give this a show. You run the
command after you run the other commands though. I wonder if you could integrate
it in the tmux bar?

### Postgres 9.5 - IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA
http://michael.otacoo.com/postgresql-2/postgres-9-5-feature-highlight-import-foreign-schema/

Just want it sounds like. Create a table from a foriegn schema.

### New Raspberry PI (model B+)
http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-raspberry-pi-model-b-plus/

Seems neat. I don’t have a raspberry pi, but I’ve been considering one to run a
monitor a company dashboard locally. Probably overkill, but who cares :).

TLDR;:
  * More GPIO
  * More USB
  * Micro SD
  * Lower power consumption
  * Better audio
  * Neater form factor

### Polyglot
https://github.com/sausheong/polyglot

I have no idea what this is really supposed to be. I gave it a very brief scan.
Seems like it’s trying to be a single web framework to run multiple programming
languages under. No idea how that’s supposed to work. Sounds cool though. I’ll
probably give it a look given all the SOA related things I’ve been doing lately.

### Bitly: Scaling to 6 billion clicks a month
http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/14/bitly-lessons-learned-building-a-distributed-system-that-han.html
http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2014/talks/lessons-learned-building-distributed-systems-at-bitly

Overview about lessons learned at Bitly. I need to give the talk (the second
link) a good watch this weekend.

### Algorithm: The Hacker Movie
http://www.thehackermovie.com/

Do you even need to ask? Cap’n Crunch liked it. Of course I’m going to watch it.

### New Parallella boards
http://www.parallella.org/2014/07/14/new-parallella-product-offerings/

If a new Raspberry PI wasn’t enough, there are new Parallella’s as well.
Probably won’t buy one for a bit, but interested. One of them is actually touted
as be a “Desktop” personal computer. I call bullshit given the spec, but what
the heck, who knows.

### SQLite: Small. Fast. Reliable.
http://charlesleifer.com/blog/sqlite-small-fast-reliable-choose-any-three-/

Nice little article reminding us that SQLite is actually a cool little DB.

### Google’s Project Zero
http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/07/announcing-project-zero.html

Google’s going to help keep us all safe on the internet now. I’m not sure
exactly what’s going on here. I think they’re just putting a bunch of security
researchers in a room and trying to beat black hats to zero day vulnerabilities.

### iTerm 2 (2.0)_
http://www.iterm2.com/news.html

Version 2.0 of iTerm 2 (is there an echo?) dropped this week. I’ve already used
triggers to try to help me stop typing full commands that I have aliases for.
I’m also going to give a look at the tmux integration. I’ll probably just stick
with my vanilla tmux, but who knows. It could be cool.

### The Tao of Programming
http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html

Totally forgot about this. Always a classic though. If you’ve never read it, I
highly recommend it. It’s worth it.


### Why We Use OCaml
http://tech.esper.com/2014/07/15/why-we-use-ocaml/

I know next to nothing about OCaml, but after reading this, I know a little more
than I did.

### Official Google Analytics iPhone App
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-analytics/id881599038?mt=8

Looks pretty slick. If I used Google Analytics more, I’d be all over it. Soon
enough I’ll pull it down and try it.

### Learn facts while pulling code changes

A colleague of mine at AlphaSights wrote an awesome pro tip on coderwall. Check
it out and learn something with every pull.
